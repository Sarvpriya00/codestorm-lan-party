I'm working on a React + Express application using react-router-dom with dynamic, permission-based routing. I‚Äôve fixed the login logic, and now I‚Äôm able to go to http://localhost:8080/login.

However, after entering the correct credentials, the login appears to work momentarily (loading spinner), but then redirects to a 404 Not Found page.

I'm trying to understand why the authenticated redirect fails and leads to a 404.

‚öôÔ∏è Context

Frontend Routing System:

Built using react-router-dom.

Uses a DynamicRouter component to fetch and render routes based on user permissions after authentication.

Fallback to NotFound page for unmatched routes.

Key files:

App.tsx: Entry point, sets up /login and /* (DynamicRouter).

DynamicRouter.tsx: Fetches /dynamic/user/routes-and-permissions after authentication.

Layout.tsx: Handles permission checks and route wrapping.

Backend:

Node.js + Express.

Exposes /api/auth for login and /api/dynamic/user/routes-and-permissions to provide routes post-login.

Authentication is via JWT.

‚úÖ What Works

Login API responds correctly.

JWT is received and stored (likely in localStorage or cookies).

/login route loads as expected.

‚ùå Problem

After successful login, the frontend tries to redirect.

It spins (loading) and then shows a 404 error page.

This likely means:

Either the route doesn‚Äôt exist in the dynamically fetched list.

Or the redirect path is incorrect or happens before routes are fully loaded.

üîç Suspicions / Areas to Investigate

Timing issue: Is the redirect happening before DynamicRouter finishes fetching and injecting routes?

Permissions: Is the user missing required permissions for the landing route (e.g., /dashboard)?

Route data: Is /dashboard or the expected post-login route even returned from the backend?

Catch-all fallback: Is the catch-all * route rendering NotFound.tsx being hit prematurely?

Frontend Auth Hook: Is the useAuth hook correctly reporting authenticated = true post-login?

üß© Desired Outcome

Help me diagnose why the login flow redirects to a 404 and how to ensure authenticated users are properly routed to their allowed pages after login.
