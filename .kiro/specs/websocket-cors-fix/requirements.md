# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CodeStorm application is experiencing WebSocket connection failures and CORS errors preventing successful user authentication. The frontend (running on port 8080) cannot connect to the backend services due to port mismatches and missing CORS configuration. This feature will resolve the connectivity issues between the frontend and backend services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to log in to the application without WebSocket connection errors, so that I can access the platform features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to log in THEN the WebSocket connection SHALL establish successfully without connection errors
2. WHEN the WebSocket connection is established THEN the authentication flow SHALL complete without CORS errors
3. WHEN the user submits valid credentials THEN the login SHALL succeed and redirect to the dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent port configuration across frontend and backend services, so that the application components can communicate properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend server starts THEN it SHALL listen on the correct port as specified in environment configuration
2. WHEN the frontend makes API requests THEN they SHALL target the correct backend port
3. WHEN WebSocket connections are initiated THEN they SHALL connect to the correct WebSocket port

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper CORS configuration, so that the frontend can make secure cross-origin requests to the backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes HTTP requests to the backend THEN CORS headers SHALL allow the requests from the frontend origin
2. WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN they SHALL not be blocked by CORS policies
3. WHEN the application runs in development mode THEN all necessary development origins SHALL be allowed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless authentication flow between HTTP and WebSocket protocols, so that I can use all application features without connection issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebSocket authentication fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to HTTP authentication gracefully
2. WHEN HTTP authentication succeeds THEN the WebSocket connection SHALL be authenticated with the user session
3. WHEN authentication completes THEN both HTTP and WebSocket connections SHALL be properly authenticated
