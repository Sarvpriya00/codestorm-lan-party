# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the post-login navigation issues where users experience "page moved" and "page not found" errors after successful authentication. The system needs proper routing management to ensure users are directed to appropriate pages based on their authentication status and role permissions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who has successfully logged in, I want to be automatically redirected to the appropriate dashboard page, so that I can immediately access the application functionality without encountering navigation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL redirect them to their role-appropriate dashboard page
2. WHEN a user accesses the root URL (/) while authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them to their dashboard instead of showing a "page not found" error
3. WHEN a user's authentication token is valid THEN the system SHALL allow access to protected routes without showing "page moved" errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user navigating the application, I want consistent routing behavior, so that I don't encounter broken links or missing pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to any valid route THEN the system SHALL display the correct page component
2. WHEN a user accesses an invalid route THEN the system SHALL display a proper 404 page with navigation options
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL properly initialize the routing system with all defined routes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with different role permissions, I want to be directed to pages I have access to, so that I don't encounter unauthorized access errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in with admin privileges THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the admin dashboard
2. WHEN a user logs in with judge privileges THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the judge queue page
3. WHEN a user logs in with participant privileges THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the problems or contest dashboard
4. IF a user tries to access a route they don't have permission for THEN the system SHALL redirect them to an appropriate accessible page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle browser navigation properly, so that back/forward buttons and direct URL access work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uses browser back/forward buttons THEN the system SHALL navigate to the correct pages
2. WHEN a user bookmarks a page URL THEN the system SHALL load the correct page when accessing the bookmark
3. WHEN a user refreshes a page THEN the system SHALL maintain their current location and authentication state
