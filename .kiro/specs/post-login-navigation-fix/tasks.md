# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Create navigation service for route management
  - Create a new service file `src/lib/navigationService.ts` with functions to determine default routes based on user permissions
  - Implement route validation and priority-based default route selection logic
  - Add error handling for route resolution failures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 2. Enhance backend route configuration with default route priorities
  - Modify `backend/src/routes/dynamic.ts` to include default route flags and priorities in the route configuration
  - Update the routes-and-permissions endpoint to return default route information
  - Add logic to determine the highest-priority accessible route for each user
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 3. Create navigation context for centralized route state management
  - Create `src/contexts/NavigationContext.tsx` to manage navigation state across the application
  - Implement context provider with current route, available routes, and default route information
  - Add methods for route validation and default navigation
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 4. Enhance DynamicRouter with improved route resolution
  - Modify `src/components/DynamicRouter.tsx` to use the navigation service for route resolution
  - Add fallback logic for when the backend API fails to return routes
  - Implement automatic redirection to default route when accessing root path
  - Add proper error boundaries for route loading failures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 5. Implement post-login redirection logic in AuthContext
  - Modify `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` to determine and redirect to appropriate default route after login
  - Add role-based redirection logic that considers user permissions and available routes
  - Implement proper cleanup and state management for authentication transitions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 6. Update Login component with enhanced redirection
  - Modify `src/pages/Login.tsx` to use the navigation service for post-login redirection
  - Remove hardcoded redirect to "/" and implement dynamic redirection based on user role
  - Add proper error handling for redirection failures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 7. Enhance Layout component with better permission handling
  - Modify `src/components/Layout.tsx` to provide better feedback when users lack permissions
  - Add suggestions for accessible routes when permission is denied
  - Implement automatic redirection to user's default route when accessing unauthorized pages
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 8. Improve NotFound component with user-specific navigation options
  - Modify `src/pages/NotFound.tsx` to show user-specific navigation options based on their permissions
  - Add logic to suggest the most relevant accessible routes for the current user
  - Implement smart redirection suggestions based on the attempted route
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 9. Add comprehensive error handling for navigation failures
  - Create error boundary components for navigation-related errors
  - Add fallback UI components for when route loading fails
  - Implement retry logic for failed route API calls
  - Add user-friendly error messages with actionable next steps
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 10. Create unit tests for navigation service and route resolution
  - Write unit tests for the navigation service route determination logic
  - Test route validation functions with various permission combinations
  - Test error handling scenarios for invalid routes and API failures
  - Create mock data for testing different user roles and permissions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 11. Create integration tests for complete login and navigation flow
  - Write integration tests that cover the complete flow from login to landing on the correct page
  - Test navigation behavior for different user roles (admin, judge, participant)
  - Test error scenarios including network failures and invalid authentication
  - Verify that browser navigation (back/forward, refresh) works correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 12. Add route caching and performance optimizations
  - Implement caching for user routes and permissions to reduce API calls
  - Add preloading logic for likely next routes based on user role
  - Optimize route resolution performance for large numbers of routes
  - Add monitoring and logging for navigation performance metrics
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 4.3_
